1. multi-way fixed effects

Wage equations ran in Stata 14 that provide two ways of estimating three-way fixed effects models. The first method is based on the Gauss-Seidel algorithm and was introduced by Guimaraes and Portugal (2010), "A simple feasible procedure to fit models with
high-dimensional fixed effects". The second method uses the command stata command reghdfe (https://scorreia.com/software/reghdfe/) which is an implementation the model by Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999). In a comment, I had the requirements for inference using the AKM framework.
